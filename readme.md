# SmartSummary – AI-Powered Study Assistant

## Project Overview
SmartSummary is an AI-powered study assistant that condenses long texts into clear and concise summaries.
It helps students, educators, and professionals quickly grasp key ideas, saving time and improving learning efficiency.

## Objectives

    Automate text summarization using AI and NLP.

    Provide quick, accurate, and structured notes.

    Support learning and productivity with time-efficient study tools.

    Ensure summaries retain the original meaning of the text.

## Features

    Accepts text input or uploaded documents.

    Generates short, medium, or detailed summaries.

    Works across domains such as academic materials, articles, blogs, and reports.

    Allows export of summaries as text or PDF.

    Simple and user-friendly interface for faster learning.

## Tech Stack

    Frontend: React (user interaction)

    Backend: FastAPI (request handling and processing)

    AI/NLP: Large Language Model (OpenAI GPT or Hugging Face Transformers)

    Database (optional): SQLite or MongoDB for storing summaries

    Deployment: Vercel, Render, or Heroku

## System Architecture

    User → Frontend (React) → Backend (FastAPI) → AI Summarizer (LLM) → Output Summary → User

## Implementation Plan

    1.Environment Setup

        Install Python and FastAPI for backend.

        Setup React for frontend.

        Connect to AI model (OpenAI or Hugging Face).

    2.Backend Development

        Create an API that accepts text input.

        Send the input to the summarization model.

        Return concise summaries in a structured format.

    3.Frontend Development

        Build an interface with a text input area.

        Provide options for summary length (short, medium, long).

        Display the summary results clearly.

## Enhancements

    Add file upload support.

    Enable download/export of summaries.

    Optionally, save past summaries for reuse.
